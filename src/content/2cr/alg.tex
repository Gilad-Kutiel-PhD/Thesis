\label{sec:greedy}

In this section we describe a natural greedy algorithm to construct a maximal
independent set of colorable paths, we discuss how this algorithm can be implemented,
and define the corresponding path-recoloring it computes.
%
We show that the approximation ratio of the greedy algorithm is $\frac{3}{2}$.
%
For the special case where the input graph is a path, 
we show that the greedy algorithm achieves a $\frac{5}{4}$ approximation ratio.
