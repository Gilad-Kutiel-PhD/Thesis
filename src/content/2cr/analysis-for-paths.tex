For the special case when the input graph is a path, 
we show that the greedy algorithm achieves a $\frac{5}{4}$ approximation ratio.
We show that the analysis is tight for this special case as well.

We start our analysis  by observing that, in the case of a path, we can replace
Lemma~\ref{lm:num_in_conflict} with the following lemma:

\begin{lemma}
For every path $p \in I$, $d_p \leq \ell_p - 2$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
We show that the number of paths in $I^*$ that
are in conflict with $p$ is at most $\ell_p - 2$.  
This is true, because if $G$ is a  path, 
then for every path that is in conflict with $p$, 
we can now associate a (unique) vertex that is not one of the endpoints of $p$.  
If the conflict is direct, then the two paths
must overlap, thus associate the other path's endpoint.  If the
conflict is indirect, then this must be due to some color other than
the one on the endpoints of $p$, or else this is a direct conflict.
{}\end{proof}

Using the above lemma we can strengthen
Lemma~\ref{lemma:alpha-squared}.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma:strong-alpha-squared}
$|D| \geq (\alpha^2+\alpha)|I|$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
The proof is similar to the proof of Lemma~\ref{lemma:alpha-squared},
where the main difference is that
\[
\sum_{p' \in I^*} \ell_{p'}
\geq \sum_{p \in I} d_p \cdot \ell_p
\geq \sum_{p \in I} (d_p^2 + 2d_p)
=    \sum_{p \in I} d_p^2 + 2|I^*|
\]
,which means that 
\[
|D| 
\geq \sum_{p' \in I^*} \ell_{p'} - |I^*|
\geq \sum_{p \in I} d_p^2 + |I^*|
=    \sum_{p \in I} d_p^2 + \alpha |I|
\geq (\alpha^2 + \alpha) |I|
\]
,and the lemma follows.
{}\end{proof}

In this case only one upper bound suffices.

\begin{theorem}
Greedy is a $\frac{5}{4}$-approximation algorithm for
\TWOCR{} on paths.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
Using Lemma~\ref{lemma:strong-alpha-squared} we get that
\begin{align*}
r	& =    
\frac{|D| - |I|}{|D| - \alpha \cdot |I|}
\\&
\leq 
\frac{
	(\alpha^2 + \alpha)|I| - |I|
}{
	(\alpha^2 + \alpha)|I| - \alpha |I|
}
\\&
=    \frac{\alpha^2 + \alpha - 1}{\alpha^2}
\\&
=    \frac{5}{4} - \frac{\alpha^2/4 - \alpha + 1}{\alpha^2}
\\&
=    \frac{5}{4} - \frac{(\alpha/2-1)^2}{\alpha^2}
\leq \frac{5}{4}
\end{align*}
,as required.
{}\end{proof}

Figure~\ref{fig:upper_bound} compares this last bound with the bounds of the general case. 
To see that our analysis is tight, consider the instance depicted in
Figure~\ref{fig:tight_path}. On this colored path, the greedy algorithm might
recolor $\frac{5}{4}$ times more vertices than the optimal recoloring.

\caption{
The greedy algorithm might choose to color the path $2 \ldots 5$, 
then it must recolor one of the vertices \{1, 10\} 
(the path $1 \ldots 10$ contains the path $2 \ldots 5$), 
one of \{6, 12\}
(the paths $2 \ldots 5$ and $6 \ldots 12$ are in indirect conflict), 
and one of \{8, 11\}
(the paths $2 \ldots 5$ and $8 \ldots 11$ are in indirect conflict),
a total of five recolored vertices,
while an optimal recoloring can recolor the paths $4 \ldots 7$ and
$8 \ldots 11$, a total of four recolored vertices.}
