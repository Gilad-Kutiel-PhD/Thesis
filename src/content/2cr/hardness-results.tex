In this section we prove that the weighted version of \TWOCR{} cannot
be approximated within any multiplicative ratio, unless P$=$NP.  We
do so using a simple reduction from the 
\textsc{Disjoint Connecting Paths} problem.

In the \textsc{Disjoint Connecting Paths} problem the input consists
of an undirected graph $G=(V,E)$ and a set of pairs $\{(s_1,
t_1), \ldots, (s_k, t_k)\}$, and the question is whether there are $k$
vertex-disjoint paths that connect $s_i$ to $t_i$.  This problem is
known to be NP-hard~\cite{karp1972reducibility}.

\begin{theorem}
The weighted version of \TWOCR{} cannot be approximated within any
 multiplicative ratio, unless P$=$NP.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
Let $G$ and $\{(s_1, t_1), \ldots, (s_k, t_k)\}$ be an instance
of \textsc{Disjoint Connecting Paths}.  We constructed a
weighted \TWOCR{} instance as follows.  First, we use the same graph
$G$.  Let $\chi(v) = c_v$ (a unique color assigned only to vertex $v$), if
$v \notin \{s_1,\ldots,s_k\} \cup \{t_1,\ldots,t_k\}$, and let
$\chi(s_i) = \chi(t_i) = c_i$, for every $i$, where $c_1, \ldots, c_k$
are distinct colors.
%
Define a weight function $w$ as follows: $w(v) = 1$, if
$v \in \{s_1,\ldots,s_k\} \cup \{t_1,\ldots,t_k\}$, and $w(v) = 0$,
otherwise.
%
It is not hard to verify that $k$ disjoint paths exist in $G$ if and
only if the minimum convex recoloring costs zero.  Hence, it is
NP-hard to decide whether a zero cost solution exists.
\end{proof}
