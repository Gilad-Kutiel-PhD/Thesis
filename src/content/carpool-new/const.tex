In this section we study the \carpool problem when the maximumcapacity is constant, i.e., when $\cmax = O(1)$.  We show that thisvariant of the problem is APX-hard even for unweighted and undirectedinstances.  We also describe and analyze a local search algorithm forthe unweighted variant of the problem, and show that the algorithmachieves a $\half + \inv{2\cmax} - \eps$ approximation ratio, for any$\varepsilon > 0$.
