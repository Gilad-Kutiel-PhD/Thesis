In this section we present a local search $(\half + \inv{2c_{\max}}
- \eps)$-approximation algoithm for unweighted \carpool whose running
time is polynomial if $c_{\max} = O(1)$.

Let $k$ be a constant integer to be determined later.
Algorithm~\textbf{EdgeSwap} (Algorithm~\ref{alg:local-new}) maintains a
feasible matching $M$ throughout its execution and operates in
iterative manner where in each iteration it tries to find a better
solution by replacing a subset of at most $k$ edges in the current
solution with another (larger) subset of edges not in the solution.
The algorithm halts when no improvement can be done.

\Return{$M$}
\end{small}
\end{algorithm}

Algorithm~\textbf{EdgeSwap} terminates in polynomial time, since in
every non-final iteration it improves the value of the solution by
one.  Thus, after at most $n$ iterations the algorithm terminates.  In
every iteration the algorithm examines all subsets of edges of a fixed
size and tests for feasibility, both these operations can be done in
polynomial time.

Observe that a vertex $v \in D_M \cup Z_M$ is the center of
a \emph{directed star} whose leaves are the passengers in the set
$P_M(v) = \set{u : (u,v) \in M}$
($P_M(v) = \emptyset$, for $v \in Z_M$).
%
Given a carpool matching $M$, we define $\calS(M)$ to be the set of
stars that are induced by $M$.  Denote by $V(S)$ the set of vertices
of a star, i.e., if $v$ is the center of $S$, then $V(S) = \{v\} \cup
P_M(v)$.  Also, let $A(S)$ be the arcs of $S$.  For
$\calT \subseteq \calS(M)$, define
$V(\calT) \eqdf \bigcup_{S \in \calT} V(S)$ and
$A(\calT) \eqdf \bigcup_{S \in \calT} A(S)$.

It remains to analyze the approximation ratio of \textbf{EdgeSwap}.
Consider an optimal matching $M^*$, and $M$ be the matching computed
by \textbf{EdgeSwap}.  Given both matchings we build the \emph{star
graph} of the two solutions in which each node represents a star from
the optimal solution, namely from $\calS(M^*)$, and an edge exists
between two nodes if there is a star in $\calS(M)$ that intersects the
two corresponding stars of the optimal solution.
%
Formally $H = (\calS(M^*), E)$ where
$$
{E = \set{(S^*_i, S^*_j) : \exists S \in \calS(M), 
         V(S) \cap V(S^*_i) \neq \emptyset \land
         V(S) \cap V(S^*_j) \neq \emptyset}}
$$

\begin{lemma}
The maximum degree of $H$ is $\cmax(\cmax+1)$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Each star in $\calS(M^*)$ contains at most $\cmax+1$ vertices and each
such vertex can belong to a star in $\calS(M)$ containing additional
$\cmax$ vertices, each of which is located in a different star in
$\calS(M^*)$.
\end{proof}

In what follows we compare $\abs{M}$ and $\abs{M^*}$ in maximal
connected components of the star graph $H$.  Intuitively, we show that
$M$ is optimal on small maximal components, and that the approximation
ratio on medium (non-necessarily) components can be bounded due to the
termination condition of \textbf{EdgeSwap}.  Large maximal components
will be partitioned into medium components.

We first show that large connected graphs (or maximal connected
components) can be partitioned in to medium size components.  

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma:dec}
An undirected connected graph $G = (V,E)$ with maximum degree
$\Delta$, can be decomposed into connected components of size at least
$\ell$ and at most $\Delta \ell$, if $\ell \leq \abs{V}$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
We give a constructive proof.
%
First, if $\ell \leq |V| \leq \Delta \ell$, then we are done.
%
Otherwise, we partition the graph recursively as follows.  Let $U
= \emptyset$.  As long as $\abs{U} < \ell$, choose an arbitrary vertex
$u$ such that $U \cup \set{u}$ is connected and add $u$ to $U$.
%
If the graph $G[V \setminus U]$, which is induced by $V \setminus U$,
is connected, then choose the next vertex.
%
However, if $G[V \setminus U]$ becomes disconnected, then consider the
maximal connected components of $G[V \setminus U]$.  Add the vertices
of any maximal component that contains less than $\ell$ vertices to
$U$.  Observe that afterwards $\abs{U} < \ell + (\Delta-1) \ell
= \Delta \ell$.
%
If $\abs{U} \geq \ell$, then recursively partition any component of
$G[V \setminus U]$ that contains more than $\ell$ vertices.
%
If $\abs{U} < \ell$, then there must exist at least one maximal
component $C$ of $G[V \setminus U]$ that contains more than $\ell$
vertices.  In this case recursively partition any maximal component of
$G[V \setminus (U \cup C)]$ that contains more than $\ell$ vertices.
Also, continue to augment $U$ in the graph $G[U \cup C]$.
\end{proof}


\iffalse %%%%%% Removed

\begin{proof}
Let $T$ be any spanning tree of $G$ and let $r$ be an arbitrary root.
Starting with $r$, repeatedly choose a child whose subtree is strictly
larger than $\frac{\Delta-1}{\Delta} \abs{V}$, until this is not
possible.  Hence, we have reached a vertex $v$ whose subtree contains
more than $\frac{\Delta-1}{\Delta} \abs{V}$ vertices, but the subtrees
of its children contain at most $\frac{\Delta-1}{\Delta} \abs{V}$
vertices.
%
If $v = r$, then $v$ has a child $u$ with at least $\inv{\Delta}
(\abs{V}-1) \geq \ell$ vertices.  Otherwise, there exists a child $u$
of $v$ whose subtree is of size at least
$\inv{\Delta} \abs{V} \geq \ell$.  Disconnect $u$ and the vertices in
its subtree from the graph.
%
In both cases $u$'s subtree contains at most
$\frac{\Delta-1}{\Delta} \abs{V}$ vertices, and thus at least
$\inv{\Delta} \abs{V} \geq \ell$ vertices remain in the graph.  Hence
we obtain two connected subgraphs of size at least $\ell$.
%
We repeat this procedure recursively on any component of size
strictly larger $\Delta\ell$.
\end{proof}

Define $\deg_M(v) \eqdf \din[M](v) + \dout[M](v)$.  For a subset
$U \subseteq V$ of vertices define $\deg_M(U) \eqdf \sum_{v \in
U} \deg_M(u)$.
%
Observe that $\abs{M} = \half \deg_M(V)$.

In the next lemma we bound the degree ratio in a component that
contains stars with at most $k$ arcs.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma:r}
Let $\calT \subseteq \calS(M^*)$ that induces a connected subgraph of
$H$.  If $\abs{A(\calT)} \leq k$, then
\[
\frac{\deg_M(V(\calT))}{\deg_{M^*}(V(\calT))} 
\geq \half + \inv{2\cmax} - \inv{2\cmax\abs{\calT}}
\]
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Consider the solution $M'$ obtained from $M$ by removing all the
edges from $M$ that intersect $V(\calT)$ and adding all the edges from
$M^*$ that intersect $V(\calT)$.  Observe that if an edge $(u,v)$ in
$M^*$ intersects $V(\calT)$, then $\set{u,v} \in V(\calT)$ by the
definition of the graph $H$.  Hence, $M'$ is feasible carpool
matching.

Since $\calT$ induces a connected subgraph of $H$, the removal of
edges in $M$ that intersect $V(\calT)$ decreased $\abs{M}$ by at most
$\deg_M(V(\calT)) - \abs{\calT} + 1$.
%
On the other hand, the increase in size is exactly
 $\half \deg_{M^*}(V(\calT)) \leq \cmax \abs{\calT}$.
%
Since $\abs{A(\calT)} \leq k$, we know that this difference can not be
positive, or else, \textsc{EdgeSwap} would not have terminated.  Thus
\(
\half \deg_{M^*}(V(\calT)) \leq \deg_M(V(\calT)) - \abs{\calT} + 1
\),
and so
\[
\frac{\deg_M(V(\calT))}{\deg_{M^*}(V(\calT))}
\geq \half + \frac{\abs{\calT} - 1}{\deg_{M^*}(V(\calT))}
\geq \half + \frac{\abs{\calT} - 1}{2\cmax \abs{\calT}}
=    \half + \inv{2\cmax} - \inv{2\cmax \abs{\calT}}
\]
as required.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
%\label{lemma:dec}
Given a parameter $k$, a connected graph $G$ with a maximum degree $d$
can be decomposed into connected components of size at least $k$, and
at most $d(k-1) + 1$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
We give a constructive proof.  Start constructing a connected
component by adding adjacent vertices one by one to the component and
removing them from the graph.  If at some point, removing a vertex
disconnect the graph, add all the small components (of size less than
$k$) to the constructed component and decompose the large components
(of size at least $k$) recursively.  Note that removing a vertex can
break the graph to at most $d - 1$ additional components.
\end{proof}

\fi %%%%% End removed

It remains to bound the approximation ratio of \textbf{EdgeSwap}.

\begin{lemma}
If $k \geq \cmax$, then $\abs{M} \geq (\half + \inv{2\cmax}
- \frac{\cmax(\cmax+1)}{2k}) \cdot \abs{M^*}$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Consider a maximal (with respect to set inclusion) connected component
of $H$ induced by the vertices in $\calT \subseteq \calS(M^*)$.
%
If $\abs{M \cap A(\calT)} \leq k$, then it must be that $\abs{M \cap
A(\calT)} = \abs{M^* \cap A(\calT)}$, since otherwise $M \cap
A(\calT)$ could be improved.

It remains to consider a maximal component $\calT$ such that If
$\abs{M \cap A(\calT)} > k$.  Since the number of edges in
$S \in \calS(M^*)$ is at most $\cmax$, it must be that $\abs{V(\calT)}
> \frac{k}{\cmax}$.
%
Due to Lemma~\ref{lemma:dec} (with $\ell
= \frac{k}{\cmax^2(\cmax+1)}$) we can partition $\calT$ into connected
components each of which contains between $\frac{k}{\cmax^2(\cmax+1)}$
and $\frac{k}{\cmax}$ vertices.
%
Since each such vertex set $\calX$ is connected and contains at most
$\frac{k}{\cmax}$ stars, it follows that $\abs{A(\calX)} \leq k$.
%
Due to Lemma~\ref{lemma:r} we have that
\(
\frac{\deg_M(V(\calX))}{\deg_{M^*}(V(\calX))} 
\geq \half + \inv{2\cmax} - \frac{\cmax(\cmax+1)}{2k}
%~.
\).
Since $\deg_{M^*}(V(\calT)) = \sum_{\calX} \deg_{M^*}(V(\calX))$ 
and
$$\deg_M(V(\calT)) = \sum_{\calX} \deg_M(V(\calX))$$, 
it follows that
\(
\frac{\deg_M(V(\calT))}{\deg_{M^*}(V(\calT))}
\geq \half + \inv{2\cmax} - \frac{\cmax(\cmax+1)}{2k}
%~,
\),
and thus
\(
\abs{M \cap A(\calT)}
\geq \paren{ \half + \inv{2\cmax} -
             \frac{\cmax(\cmax+1)}{2k}} \abs{M^* \cap A(\calT)}
%~,
\).
%and the lemma follows.
\end{proof}

By setting $k = \ceil{\cmax(\cmax+1)/2\eps}$, we get the following
result.

\begin{corollary}
\label{cor:local}
There exists a $(\half + \inv{2\cmax} - \eps)$-approximation algorithm
for unweighted \carpool, for every $\eps>0$.
\end{corollary}

We now show that Corollary~\ref{cor:local} is tight.  
Consider the
example in Figure~\ref{fig:local search tight}, the example is for the
special case when $k = 11$ and $\cmax = 2$ but this example can be
generalized in a straightforward manner.  One can verify that as the
graph in the example growth, the ratio between the optimal solution
and the local search solution approaches $\frac{3}{4}$.
