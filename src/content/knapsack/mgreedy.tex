Let $O$ be an optimal set and recall that we assume that $f(O) = 1$.
Let $T = \arg\max\{S, \displaystyle{\arg\max_{e \in U}}f(\{e\})\}$ 
be the set returned by the modified greedy algorithm, 
where $S$ is the set computed by the greedy algorithm~\ref{alg:greedy},
we prove the following theorem:

\begin{theorem}
$f(T) \geq (1 - e^{-1/2})$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
We can assume that $f(e) \leq 1 - e^{-1/2}$ for every $e \in U$ or otherwise the proof holds. 
Note, also, that if $|O \setminus T| \leq 1$ then $f(T) \geq 0.5$. 
Thus we assume the algorithm drops at least two elements from $O$ during its running. 
Denote by $x$ and $y$ the first and second such elements respectively.
Denote by $A$ the set of elements chosen by the algorithm just before dropping $x$ and by
$B$ the set of elements chosen right after dropping $x$ and before dropping $y$.
If $f(A) \geq 1 - e^{-1/2}$ the theorem holds, otherwise denote $f(A) = 1 - e^{-(1/2 - \delta)}$,
where $\delta$ might be in the range $(0, 0.5)$.  

We argue that the following inequalities hold:

\begin{align}
\label{mgreedy:ineq1}
c(A) \leq 0.5 - \delta 
\\
\label{mgreedy:ineq2}
c(x) > 0.5 + \delta
\\
\label{mgreedy:ineq3}
c(O \setminus x) \leq 0.5 - \delta
\\
\label{mgreedy:ineq4}
c(B) > 2\delta
\\
\label{ineq:T}
f(O \setminus x | A) \geq f(O) - f(x) - f(A) \geq e^{-1/2} - 1 + e^{-(1/2 - \delta)}
\\
\label{ineq:B}
f(B|A) \geq (1 - e^{-\frac{2\delta}{1/2 - \delta}})f(O \setminus x | A)
\\
f(T) \geq f(A) + f(B|A)
\end{align}

Where inequality \ref{mgreedy:ineq1} is due to Lemma~\ref{lemma:sub-main},
the fact that $x$ was dropped right after $A$ implies inequality \ref{mgreedy:ineq2},
inequality \ref{mgreedy:ineq4} is due to inequalities \ref{mgreedy:ineq3} and 
\ref{mgreedy:ineq2},
inequality \ref{ineq:T} is due to submodularity of $f$, 
inequality \ref{ineq:B} is due to Lemma~\ref{lemma:sub-main} and inequalities 
\ref{mgreedy:ineq4} and \ref{mgreedy:ineq3}, 
the last inequality is due to monotonicity and the definition of $f(B|A)$.   

Substituting $f(A) = 1 - e^{-(1/2 - \delta)}$ 
and $f(B|A) \geq (1 - e^{-\frac{2\delta}{1/2 - \delta}})f(O \setminus x | A)$
into the last inequality gives the desired result as can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:mgreedy}
\end{proof}

% \textbf{Upper Bound}
% In \cite{khuller1999budgeted} it is claimed that the upper bound on the approximation ratio
% of the modified greedy algorithm is at most 0.44, but no explicit instance was given to 
% support this claim and we could not reproduce such an example.
% Here we give a simple example that bound the approximation ratio from above by $1-e^{-2/3}$, 
% leaving a gap between the lower and upper bounds.
% Consider an instance of the budgeted maximum coverage problem where the optimal cover consists
% of 3 disjoint subsets, $S_1, S_2, S_3$ each cover exactly third of the ground set. 
% In this example we assume a uniform weight function, and suppose the cost of each subsets of 
% the optimal solution is $1/3$. We now describe the subsets that the modified greedy algorithm
% may choose. Consider $k + 1$ disjoint subsets $T_1, \dots, T_{k + 1}$ where $c(T_i) = 2/3k$, 
% where subset $T_i$ covers $\frac{2}{3k}(1-\frac{2}{3k})^i$ fraction of the ground set and for
% every $i$ it holds that $|T_i \cap S_1| = |T_i \cap S_2| = |T_i \cap S_3|$.
% One can verify that the modified greedy algorithm might chose those sets leaving no budget for
% any of the optimal subsets. As $k$ approaches infinity the total value of those sets approches
% $1-e^{-2/3}$.
