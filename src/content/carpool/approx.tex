We present two algorithms for \carpool: a $\frac{1}{2}$-approx\-imation
algorithm that is based on formulating the problem as an unconstrained
submodular maximization problem and a local search $(\frac{1}{2}
- \varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm.  While the latter does not
improve upon the former, it will be shown (in Section~\ref{sec:group})
that it can be generalized to \gcp without decreasing the
approximation ratio.
