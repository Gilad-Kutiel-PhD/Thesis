A super-matching is a relaxed variant of the \CARPOOL{} problem 
where every node can act both as a driver and as a passenger. 
Formally, given a directed graph $G = (V, A)$, 
a capacity function $ c: V \rightarrow \N $,
and a weight function $w : A \rightarrow \R$,
a \emph{super-matching} is a set $M \subseteq A$, 
under the constraint that $\forall v \in V$,
$\din(v) \leq c(v)$, and $\dout(v) \leq 1$. 
%
Clearly, the following observation holds:
\begin{observation}
\label{ob:matching is super}
Every matching $(P, V, M)$ is a super-matching $M$
\end{observation}

A maximum super matching can be found efficiently by the following reduction 
to a maximum weight flow problem: 
Let $N = (G', s, t, c', w')$ be a flow network, where 
\begin{align*}
G'				& = (P \cup D \cup \{s, t\}, A_{sp} \cup A_{pd} \cup A_{dt})	\\
P				& = \{p_v : v \in V\}					\\
D				& = \{d_v : v \in V\}					\\
A_{sp}			& = \{ (s, p_v) : p_v \in P \}			\\
A_{pd}			& = \{ ((p_u, d_v)) : (u, v) \in A \}	\\
A_{dt}			& = \{ (d_v, t) : d_v \in D \}			\\
c'(s, p_v)		& = c'(p_u, d_v) = 1					\\
c'(d_v, t)		& = c(v)								\\
w'(p_u, d_v)	& = 
\begin{cases}
w(u, v) & \text{if } (p_u, d_v) \in A_{pd} \\
0 & \text{otherwise}	
\end{cases}
\end{align*}

That is, 
we construct a bipartite graph where the left side represents each vertex 
in $V$ being a passenger,
and the right side represents each vertex in $V$ being a driver.
Figure~\ref{fig:cm-flow} illustrates this flow network.

One can verify that this is indeed a (integral) flow network and that there is a
straight forward translation between a flow and a super matching with the same weight.
