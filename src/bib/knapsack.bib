Through simple encodings from such domains into the set of words over a finite alphabet these problems can be converted into language recognition problems, and we can inquire into their computational complexity. It is reasonable to consider such a problem satisfactorily solved when an algorithm for its solution is found which terminates within a number of steps bounded by a polynomial in the length of the input. We show that a large number of classic unsolved problems of covering, matching, packing, routing, assignment and sequencing are equivalent, in the sense that either each of them possesses a polynomial-bounded algorithm or none of them does.",

This problem is NP-hard. For the special case of this problem, where each set has unit cost, a (1−1/e)-approximation is known. Yet, prior to this work, no approximation results were known for the general cost version. The contribution of this paper is a (1−1/e)-approximation algorithm for the budgeted maximum coverage problem. We also argue that this approximation factor is the best possible, unless NP⫅DTIME(nO(loglogn))."

Thus, to maximize its available funds, a company that pays bills to numerous clients in various locations may find it advantageous to maintain accounts in several strategically located banks. We will discuss the problem of optimally locating bank accounts to maximize clearing times. The importance of this problem depends in part on its mathematical equivalence to the well-known uncapacitated plant location problem. We present a Lagrangian dual for obtaining an upper bound and heuristics for obtaining a lower bound on the value of an optimal solution. Our main results are analytical worst-case analyses of these bounds. In particular we show that the relative error of the dual bound and a “greedy” heuristic never exceeds [(K − 1)/K]k < 1/e for a problem in which at most K locations are to be chosen. Two other heuristics are shown to have worst-case relative errors of at least (k − 1)/(2K − 1) < 1/2. Examples are given showing that all these bounds can be achieved. We present extensive computational results for these approximations. }
