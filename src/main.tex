\begin{abstract}
    We consider the problem of maximizing a monotone submodular function under a knapsack constraint.
    We propose a simple and fast algorithm to the problem that runs in $O(n^2)$ time (with very small constants) and achieves a $(1-e^{-2/3})$ approximation.
    As a side effect of our work we fix a logical flaw in the analysis of the ModifiedGreedy algorithm for this problem as appeared in \cite{khuller1999budgeted} and \cite{krause2005note}.
    We also analyze the Modified$^2$Greedy algorithm and able to show a better lower bound to its approximation ratio compared to the ModifiedGreedy algorithm.
